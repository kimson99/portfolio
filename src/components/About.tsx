        <p>
          As a Sofware Developer, my fascination with programming began early at
          12, through starting a Minecraft server with friends. I began working
          professionaly in 2020 while still in college, since then I have been
          actively honing my skills ever since. My experties lies primarily in
          the web and server domains, where I build robust and scalable
          applications.
        </p>

          Beyond that, I also find joy in art, reading and fitness. I strive to
          better myself everyday, constantly seeking new challenges and creative
          outlets.
